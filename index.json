In recent years, a large number of automatic malware detection and classification systems have evolved to tackle the dynamic nature of malware growth using either static or dynamic analysis techniques. Performance of static malware detection methods degrade due to the obfuscation attacks. Although many benchmark datasets are available to measure the performance of malware detection and classification systems, only a single obfuscated malware dataset (PRAGuard) is available to showcase the efficacy of the existing malware detection systems against the obfuscation attacks. PRAGuard contains outdated samples till March 2013 and does not represent the latest application categories. Moreover, PRAGuard does not provide the family information for malware because of which PRAGuard can not be used to evaluate the efficacy of the malware family classification systems.  In this work, we create and release AndroOBFS, a time-tagged (at month granularity) obfuscated malware dataset with familial information spanning over three years from 2018 to 2020. We create this dataset by obfuscating 16279 unique real-world malware in six different obfuscation categories. Out of 16279 obfuscated malware samples, 14579 samples are distributed across 158 families with at least two unique malware samples in each family. We release this dataset to facilitate Android malware study towards designing robust and obfuscation resilient malware detection and classification systems.","tags":[],"title":"AndroOBFS: Time-tagged Obfuscated Android Malware Dataset with Family Information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arun KP","Saurabh Kumar","Debadatta Mishra","Biswabandan Panda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646352000,"objectID":"0f56e81cc2b80312a38aa1de9f24ea39","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/publication/snip/","publishdate":"2022-03-04T10:58:33+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/snip/","section":"publication","summary":"Usage of the execution stack at run-time captures the dynamic state of programs and can be used to derive useful insights into the program behaviour. The stack usage information can be used to identify and debug performance and security aspects of applications. Binary run-time instrumentation techniques are well known to capture the memory access traces during program execution. Tracing the program in entirety and filtering out stack specific accesses is a commonly used technique for stack related analysis. However, applying vanilla tracing techniques (using tools like Intel Pin) for multi-threaded programs has challenges such as identifying the stack areas to perform efficient run-time tracing. In this paper, we introduce SniP, an open-source stack tracing framework for multi-threaded programs built around Intel’s binary instrumentation tool Pin. SniP provides a framework for efficient run-time tracing of stack areas used by multi-threaded applications by identifying the stack areas dynamically. The targeted tracing capability of SniP is demonstrated using a range of multi-threaded applications to show its efficacy in terms of trace size and time to trace. Compared to full program tracing using Pin, SniP achieves up to 75X reduction in terms of trace file size and up to 24X reduction in time to trace. SniP complements existing trace based stack usage analysis tools and we demonstrate that SniP can be easily integrated with the analysis framework through different use-cases.","tags":[],"title":"SniP: An Efficient Stack Tracing Framework for Multi-threaded Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Debadatta Mishra","Sandeep Kumar Shukla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1639128896,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639128896,"objectID":"25dc7125745baa32e0b5ff5de206ca1f","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/publication/mapfam/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T15:04:56+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/mapfam/","section":"publication","summary":"With the increased popularity and wide adoption as a mobile OS platform, Android has been a major target for malware authors. Due to unprecedented rapid growth in the number, variants, and diversity of malware, detecting malware on the Android platform has become challenging. Beyond the detection of a malware, classifying the family the malware belongs to, helps security analysts to reuse malware removal techniques that is known to work for that family of malware. It takes manual analysis if a malware belongs to an unknown family. Therefore, classifying malware into exact family is important. This paper presents a technique and tool named MAPFam that applies machine learning on static features from the Manifest file and API packages to classify an Android malware into its family. This work is premised on a starting hypothesis that features extracted from API packages rather than on API calls lead to more precise classification. Our experiments indeed shows that API package based models provides ~1.63X more accurate classification compared to an API call based method. Our machine learning based malware family classification system uses API packages, requested permissions, and other features from the Manifest files. The proposed family classification system achieves accuracy and average precision above 97% for the top 60 malware families by using only 81 features with 97.55% of model reliability rate (Kappa score). The experimental results also shows that MAPFam can perfectly identity 36 malware families.","tags":[],"title":"Android Malware Family Classification: What Works -- API Calls, Permissions or API Packages?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Debadatta Mishra","Biswabandan Panda","Sandeep Kumar Shukla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638769901,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638769901,"objectID":"1fa8b840178075d6b57828305bb6d3ca","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/publication/deepdetect/","publishdate":"2021-12-06T11:21:41+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/deepdetect/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the past few years, Android has become one of the most popular operating systems for smartphones as it is open-source and provides extensive support for wide variety of applications. This has led to an increase in the number of malware targeting Android devices. The lack of robust security enforcement in Play Store along with the rapid increase in the number of new Android malware presents a scope for a variety of diverse malicious applications to spread across devices. Furthermore, Android allows installation of an application from unverified sources (e.g., third-party market and sideloading), which opens up other ways for malware to infect the smartphones. This paper presents DeepDetect that enables on-device malware detection by employing a machine learning based model on static features. With effective feature engineering, DeepDetect can be used on-device. To classify an Android application as malware, it takes ∼5.32 seconds, which is 2.23X faster than API based malware detector, while consuming 0.45% (for 50 applications) of total device energy. DeepDetect provides a malware detection rate of 99.9% for known malware with a 0.01% false-positive rate. For unseen/new samples, it detects more than 97% malware with a false-positive rate of 1.73%. Further, in the presence of obfuscated malware, DeepDetect correctly detects 95.57% of malware samples. We have also evaluated our model against the Pegasus malware sample and with a new dataset after removing the potential biases across space and time.","tags":[],"title":"DeepDetect: A Practical On-device Android Malware Detector","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635323400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635323400,"objectID":"0f70c83f0fb99d53d1957434cc753b67","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/talk/mobile-forensics-and-challenges-perspective-of-indian-investigators/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T13:20:47+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/mobile-forensics-and-challenges-perspective-of-indian-investigators/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Mobile Forensics and Challenges: Perspective of Indian Investigators","type":"event"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Debadatta Mishra","Biswabandan Panda","Sandeep Kumar Shukla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1607472000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607472000,"objectID":"0f32793077afb67625095476d38f84ed","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/publication/stdneut/","publishdate":"2021-11-23T10:58:33+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/stdneut/","section":"publication","summary":"Sophisticated malware employs various emulation-detection techniques to bypass the dynamic analysis systems that are running on top of virtualized environments. Hence, a defense mechanism needs to be incorporated in emulation based analysis platforms to mitigate the emulation-detection strategies opted by malware.

We use this library to arm several existing malware with different levels of emulation-detection capabilities and study the efficacy of anti-emulation-detection measures of well known emulator driven dynamic analysis frameworks. Furthermore, we propose STDNeut (Sensor, Telephony system, and Device state information Neutralizer) -- a configurable anti-emulation-detection mechanism that defends against the basic as well as advanced emulation-detection techniques regardless of which layer of Android OS the attack is performed on. Finally, we perform various experiments to show the effectiveness of STDNeut.

As a matter of fact while taking these things into consideration security issues related to data are always overlooked and this can cause a big problem.

Each node operates not only as an end system, but also as a router to forward packets. The nodes are free to move and organize themselves into a network. These nodes change position frequently. A routing protocol is used to find routes between mobile nodes to facilitate the communication within the network. The main goal of such a mobile ad hoc routing protocol is to establish and maintain a correct and efficient route between the pair of nodes so that they can communicate with each other. In this work an attempt has been made to compare the performance of three different routing protocols for MANETs: - AODV (Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector), DSR (Dynamic Source Routing), and WRP (Wireless Routing Protocol). As per our findings, the differences in the protocol mechanism lead to significant performance differentials for all of these protocols. The performance differentials are analyzed using two scenario i.e. variable pause time and variable number of nodes. We used random waypoint mobility model and uniform node placement strategy to design the network and performed simulation by using GloMoSim version 2.03 simulator. The performance analysis is based on different network metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput and average end-to-end delay. The results presented in this work illustrated the importance in carefully evaluating and implementing routing protocols in Mobile Ad Hoc environment.","tags":[],"title":"Simulation based Performance Comparison of AODV, DSR and WRP Routing Protocols in MANET using Random Waypoint Mobility Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
